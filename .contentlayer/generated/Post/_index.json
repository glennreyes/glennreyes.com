Since I haven't done a review like this before nor have I written any blog posts (duh!), I wanted to take the opportunity and sum up the most important things I have done this year.\n\n## Traveling\n\n![](./traveling.jpg 'Traveling')\n\nI visited 8 different countries:\n\n- 🇺🇸 USA\n- 🇲🇽 Mexico\n- 🇵🇭 Philippines\n- 🇪🇸 Spain\n- 🇩🇪 Germany\n- 🇵🇱 Poland\n- 🇭🇷 Croatia\n- 🇺🇦 Ukraine\n\n![](./sunset.jpg 'Sunset in Philippines')\n\nWhere as the ones overseas were mostly for leisure and the closer ones for business. Vacation was mostly spent for quality time reasons with the family and relatives. Besides, I got to do some fun things like...\n\n![](./courtside.jpg 'Courtside NBA')\n\n... Watching an (my first!) NBA game from a court side seat in OKC or...\n\n![](./diving.jpg 'Diving in Bohol, Philippines')\n\n... Getting a PADI Open Water Scuba Diving license.\n\n![](./warsaw.png 'Warsaw metropole')\n\nDuring my travels to Spain, Germany, Poland, Croatia and Ukraine I attended to dozens of developer conferences to share my experiences about React & GraphQL.\n\n## Giving workshops about GraphQL\n\nThis year I started something that I always wanted to do: Teaching. I gave workshops to help people working with GraphQL. Back in April, [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) 🇫🇮gave me the opportunity to host my first workshop. From there I was able to continue giving workshops at other events and places. Here's the full list:\n\n- 🇫🇮 [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/)\n- 🇪🇸 [React Alicante](https://reactalicante.es/)\n- 🇦🇹 [UpLeveled](https://upleveled.io)\n- 🇭🇷 [WebCamp Zagreb](https://2019.webcampzg.org/)\n- 🇵🇱 [FrontEnd Con](https://frontend-con.io/)\n\n![](./workshop.jpg 'Workshop in Alicante, Spain')\n\nGiving workshops is something which I'm totally passionate about which I'm definitely looking forward to continuing in the upcoming years. So keep updated and check out my [workshops](/workshops).\n\n## Public speaking\n\n![](./speaking.jpg 'Speaking at JSFest Autumn')\n\nThis year I was able to share my thoughts and experiences at 11 conferences and events. I met super nice people and friends along the way. I'm super grateful for all event organizers for giving me the opportunity. I'm looking forward for further collabs in the future.\n\n![](./speaking-3.jpg 'Speaking at WebCamp Zagreb')\n\n## Focusing health\n\nIn December 2018, I was diagnosed with a [lipid disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia) so I decided to take serious actions in 2019.\n\nBasically, I was recommended to doing this:\n\n- Eat skinless poultry with no visible fat\n- Eat lean meats, in moderate portions\n- Eat low-fat or fat-free dairy products\n- Consume polyunsaturated fats and mono-unsaturated fat instead of saturated fats and trans fats\n- Exercise for at least 30 minutes per day, 4 days per week\n- Avoid fast food, junk food, and processed meats\n- Eating grilled and roasted foods instead of fried foods\n- Drink less alcohol (triglyceride)\n\n> _tl;dr I had to lose some body weight and stay in shape._\n\n### Pescatarian diet\n\nI decided to switch to a pescatarian diet which allowed me to eat healthier while consuming valuable Omega-3 fatty acids to lower my [triglycerides](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186) and [LDL levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein).\n\n![](./food.jpg 'Shaka bowls in Bohol, Philippines')\n\nPescatarian is fairly easy to follow and I got used to it in just a few months. Cutting meat was for sure not an easy task but overall, I feel noticably better having them replaced by vegetables and fruits.\n\nIn the future I will definitely continue pescatarian and focus more towards plantbased products.\n\n### Sports\n\nI started to dedicate around 3-4 hours per week in actively doing sports. In the first months it was mostly running and strength workouts. Now, I'm trying to go regularly for a swim, ride and run at least once each per week.\n\n![](./cycling.jpg 'Cycling in Vienna')\n\nI track all my [activities on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783), feel free to follow along.\n\n### Losing body weight\n\nI dropped 14kg body weight in one year. Ideally, I lose another 6kg and keep at ideal BMI range. It's worth mentioning that I care about healthy nutrition and activities more than losing weight. But it's nice to have it as another metric for measuring purposes.\n\n## What to expect in 2020\n\nIn the upcoming year I will help two companies build products in React and React Native.\n\n### Teaching and speaking\n\nAs of today, I have only confirmed to speak at [AgentConf 2020](https://agent.sh) in January. In 2020, I will be reducing submitting talks to conference so I can focus more on actual work and things I'm also passionate about.\n\n![](./speaking-2.jpg 'Speaking at JSFest Autumn')\n\nI will be continuing giving workshops and do company trainings about GraphQL & React. So if you're a conference/community/event organizer or intested in an on-site company training, feel free to [reach out](mailto:glenn@glennreyes.com) and check out [my workshops](/workshops).\n\n### Creating music\n\nI used to do music and play guitar often during the years when I was studying and have completely neglected it since I started to work. I want to change that. I will dedicate some time in creating music and relearning the basics.\n\n### Health\n\nAs in 2019, I will try to stay pescatarian but focus more on consuming plantbased products. I will also do my best to keep exercising regularly.\n",

      "raw": "\nWith Code Splitting we are able to reduce kilobytes sent over the wire and potentially improve page speed. Code Splitting is a such an easy-to-use feature that every single page app should consider to add (if haven’t yet).\n\n## So why disable Code Splitting?\n\nWell, of course we shouldn’t!\n\nIf you are building server-side rendered apps in React with [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/) support baked in, some might use zero-configuration tools like [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), which runs two webpack instances, one for the client and the other for the server, and it builds everything for the client and for the server for you.\n\n## Let’s build an app with Code Splitting\n\nAfter defining some major split points in your app, you want to build and see how the chunks are doing so far:\n\n![Webpack build](./build.png 'Webpack build')\n\nAnd in the file explorer:\n\n![File explorer](./file-explorer.png 'File explorer')\n\nBut wait?\n\n![Server files](./server-files.png 'Server files')\n\n## What is happening here?\n\nBecause our app is splitting bundles both on the client and server, multiple bundles are created for the server too, which we don’t really want/need. So we end up having multiple split up _\\[number\\]_._server.js._ What we want is:\n\n📝 One single server.js.\n\n## Let’s fix it\n\nOne way would be to create another build step to delete all \\[number\\].server.js, but that would be the last (or not an) option.\n\nA better way would be to tweak the webpack config to _disable Code Splitting for the server_. Doing some research I came across [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jcenturion/892c718abce234243a156255f8f52468) by [@jcenturion86](https://twitter.com/jcenturion86) and learned about [LimitChunkCountPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/limit-chunk-count-plugin) that allows me to set a limit ofhow many chunks should be created*.* So the config looks like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.optimize.LimitChunkCountPlugin({\n      maxChunks: 1,\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nWith this, one single chunk/bundle will be created and voila: Code Splitting is disabled.\n\nSo in Razzle, we want to set it only for the server by doing this in the razzle.config.js:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n        loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n        include: ['src'],\n        options: {\n          presets: [\n            'dynamic-import-node',\n            'remove-webpack',\n          ],\n        }\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nSome people encountered type or runtime errors with this approach. So alternatively, we could add these two babel plugins: [babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node) to transpile _import()_ to a deferred _require()_ and then remove webpack features with [babel-plugin-remove-webpack](https://github.com/knpwrs/babel-plugin-remove-webpack):\n\nBoth solutions solve the same issue:\n\n![Server file](./server-file.png 'Server file')\n\n✅ One single server.js\n",
