In this workshop, participants are going to build a fully fledged GraphQL application from the ground up and interact with it through a React app. This workshop is targeted to engineers who are interested in building a modern GraphQL server on top of a React frontend application.

## Topics covered

- GraphQL core concepts introduction
- GraphQL server setup
- Exploring the GraphQL API and the Schema Definition Language
- GraphQL fragments, queries & mutations
- Authentication & access control patterns
- Real-time events with GraphQL subscriptions
- Improving network performance through automatic persisted queries

## Prerequisites

Developers have basic knowledge about the core concepts of React. Bring your own laptop (I'm on Mac). Make sure, latest node and yarn or npm works on your machine.

## Goals

Developers will be able to build full stack React apps with GraphQL using open source libraries. The goal is to reduce the pain of dealing with traditional REST architectures by using GraphQL.
