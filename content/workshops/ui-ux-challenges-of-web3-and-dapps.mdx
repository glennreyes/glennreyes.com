With the next generation of the web (Web3) we observe a progressive transition of traditional centralized web apps to decentralized apps (Dapps). They can natively interact with blockchain technologies and unlock endless new ideas and innovation. Interacting with Dapps today can often lead to uncertain and frightening actions which lead to frustration and skepticism. In this session, attendees will deep-dive into Web3 and Dapps fundamentals and see how we got there, clear up confusions and explore how we can improve user experiences to help bringing Dapps closer to people.
