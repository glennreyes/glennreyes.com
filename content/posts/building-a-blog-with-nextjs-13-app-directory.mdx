In recent years, Next.js has become a very popular choice for building web applications and websites, due to its ease of use and flexibility. With the recent release of Next.js 13, there are even more features and improvements to make your development process even smoother.

One of the new features in Next.js 13 is the `app` directory, which provides a centralized place to customize the behavior of the Next.js application. In this blog post, we will explore how to build a blog with Next.js 13 using the `app` directory.

## Getting Started

Let's create a new Next.js application. I prefer to use `pnpm`, so the command for creating a new Next.js application is:

```bash
pnpx create next-app my-blog
```

Alternatively, you can use `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog
```

```bash
yarn create next-app my-blog
```

During the installation, you will be asked various questions about your project. For this blog, we want to use TypeScript, so we will select `Yes` when asked if we want to use TypeScript. We will also select `Yes` when asked if we want to use the new `app` directory.
