2019 was full of exciting things. Since I haven't done a review like this before nor have I written any blog posts (duh!), I wanted to take the opportunity and sum up the most important things I have done this year.

## Traveling

![](./traveling.jpg 'Traveling')

- 🇪🇸 Spain

Where as the ones overseas were mostly for leisure and the closer ones for business. Vacation was mostly spent for quality time reasons with the family and relatives. Besides, I got to do some fun things like...

... Watching an (my first!) NBA game from a court side seat in OKC or...

... Getting a PADI Open Water Scuba Diving license.

During my travels to Spain, Germany, Poland, Croatia and Ukraine I attended to dozens of developer conferences to share my experiences about React & GraphQL.

## Giving workshops about GraphQL

This year I started something that I always wanted to do: Teaching. I gave workshops to help people working with GraphQL. Back in April, [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) 🇫🇮gave me the opportunity to host my first workshop. From there I was able to continue giving workshops at other events and places. Here's the full list:

- 🇫🇮 [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/)
- 🇪🇸 [React Alicante](https://reactalicante.es/)
- 🇦🇹 [UpLeveled](https://upleveled.io)
- 🇭🇷 [WebCamp Zagreb](https://2019.webcampzg.org/)
- 🇵🇱 [FrontEnd Con](https://frontend-con.io/)

Giving workshops is something which I'm totally passionate about which I'm definitely looking forward to continuing in the upcoming years. So keep updated and check out my [workshops](/workshops).

## Public speaking

This year I was able to share my thoughts and experiences at 11 conferences and events. I met super nice people and friends along the way. I'm super grateful for all event organizers for giving me the opportunity. I'm looking forward for further collabs in the future.

## Focusing health

In December 2018, I was diagnosed with a [lipid disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlipidemia) so I decided to take serious actions in 2019.

Basically, I was recommended to doing this:

- Eat skinless poultry with no visible fat
- Eat lean meats, in moderate portions
- Eat low-fat or fat-free dairy products
- Consume polyunsaturated fats and mono-unsaturated fat instead of saturated fats and trans fats
- Exercise for at least 30 minutes per day, 4 days per week
- Avoid fast food, junk food, and processed meats
- Eating grilled and roasted foods instead of fried foods
- Drink less alcohol (triglyceride)

> _tl;dr I had to lose some body weight and stay in shape._

### Pescatarian diet

I decided to switch to a pescatarian diet which allowed me to eat healthier while consuming valuable Omega-3 fatty acids to lower my [triglycerides](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186) and [LDL levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein).

Pescatarian is fairly easy to follow and I got used to it in just a few months. Cutting meat was for sure not an easy task but overall, I feel noticably better having them replaced by vegetables and fruits.

In the future I will definitely continue pescatarian and focus more towards plantbased products.

### Sports

I started to dedicate around 3-4 hours per week in actively doing sports. In the first months it was mostly running and strength workouts. Now, I'm trying to go regularly for a swim, ride and run at least once each per week.

I track all my [activities on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783), feel free to follow along.

### Losing body weight

I dropped 14kg body weight in one year. Ideally, I lose another 6kg and keep at ideal BMI range. It's worth mentioning that I care about healthy nutrition and activities more than losing weight. But it's nice to have it as another metric for measuring purposes.

## What to expect in 2020

In the upcoming year I will help two companies build products in React and React Native.

### Teaching and speaking

As of today, I have only confirmed to speak at [AgentConf 2020](https://agent.sh) in January. In 2020, I will be reducing submitting talks to conference so I can focus more on actual work and things I'm also passionate about.

I will be continuing giving workshops and do company trainings about GraphQL & React. So if you're a conference/community/event organizer or intested in an on-site company training, feel free to [reach out](mailto:glenn@glennreyes.com) and check out [my workshops](/workshops).

### Creating music

I used to do music and play guitar often during the years when I was studying and have completely neglected it since I started to work. I want to change that. I will dedicate some time in creating music and relearning the basics.

### Health

As in 2019, I will try to stay pescatarian but focus more on consuming plantbased products. I will also do my best to keep exercising regularly.
