I am driven by a constant thirst for knowledge and a passion for discovering and exploring new technologies. Sharing my thoughts and ideas with others is one of my favorite things to do, particularly when it comes to the technologies that I am deeply invested in. As a result, I regularly [speak](/talks) at tech conferences and meetups and also run [workshops](/workshops) and trainings on emerging web technologies such as React, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

If you're curious about the tools and software that I use on a daily basis, you can check out my [uses page](/uses) to get an inside look at my setup.

When I'm not in front of a computer, I enjoy spending quality time with my family, playing the guitar, and pursuing various outdoor activities such as [diving](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoPXmm8NrjQ/), [cycling, swimming and running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783).
