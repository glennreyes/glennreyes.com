I’m someone who’s always curious and excited about trying new things, especially when it comes to tech. Over time that curiosity turned into a career where I get to build, learn, and share what I know with others. I [speak](/talks) at conferences and meetups, and I run [workshops](/workshops) on React, GraphQL, and TypeScript—topics I’ve been passionate about for years.

If you’d like to see the gear and apps I use every day, have a look at my [uses page](/uses).

When I’m not coding, I’m usually hanging out with the people closest to me, playing guitar, or spending time outdoors. I love [diving](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJiPOndzM_8), and I stay active with [cycling, swimming, and running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783).
