I’ve always been curious about how things work and how they can be refined. That curiosity led me into tech, where I get to build, learn, and share along the way. I [speak](/talks) at conferences and meetups, and I run [workshops](/workshops) on React, GraphQL, and TypeScript—topics I’ve been passionate about for years. I enjoy shaping UI systems that are both reliable and flexible, and I like keeping products feeling modern and effortless to use.

If you’d like to see the gear and apps I use every day, have a look at my [uses page](/uses).

When I’m not coding, I’m usually with the people closest to me, playing guitar, or spending time outdoors. I love [diving](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJiPOndzM_8), and I stay active with [cycling, swimming, and running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783).
