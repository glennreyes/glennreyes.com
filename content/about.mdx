I am addicted to constantly learn new things and enjoy sharing my thoughts and ideas about technologies I deeply care about. One way of my favorite ways to share knowledge is by speaking at tech conferences and meetups. I run workshops and trainings on emerging web technologies such as React, GraphQL and TypeScript.

Away from the keyboard, I enjoy spending quality time with my family, play the guitar and go diving, [cycling, swimming and running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783).
