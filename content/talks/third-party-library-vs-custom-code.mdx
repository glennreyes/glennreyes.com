title: Third party library vs. custom code: Making architectural decisions
---

When we write new code, often times we might be like: “Come on, there must be something out there!” And most times there was already someone who faced the same problem... only that it's not quite the same. And then we ask ourselves: Should I use that 3rd party library? Or roll my own? If not sure, join this party to discuss the challenges and drawbacks, and explore architectural decisions to help make better apps and products.
