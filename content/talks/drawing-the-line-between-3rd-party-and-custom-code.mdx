title: Drawing the line between 3rd party and custom code
---

Often when we write new code, we think: Come on, there must be something out there! And sometimes, someone faced the same problem already... only that it's not quite the same.

How does our intrinsic decision making impact the quality and scalability of our code? Why do we use third party libraries from npm? When do we roll our own code?

In this talk I will share best practices that helped me writing better code through better decision making. We will deep dive into multiple scenarios of the continuous decision making we do and explore common differences & problems.
