# Uses

Although I try to keep my setup as minimal as possible, I mostly manage every here and then to try and get new stuff.

## Hardware

#### [13" MacBook Pro (Late 2016)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro)

- Maxed-out
- 1GB SSD
- Yes, two keyboard buttons stopped working once in 2018

#### [Magic Keyboard](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/MLA22LL?wid=890&hei=890&fmt=jpeg&qlt=95&op_usm=0.5,0.5&.v=1496944005839)

I tried once the one with the numeric keypad, but barely used them so switched back to the compact one.

#### [Magic Mouse](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/MLA02?wid=890&hei=890&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&op_usm=0.5,0.5&.v=1564098735372)

I love everything about it except the charging notification at 2%.

#### [27" LG 27UD88-W 4K monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UD88-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor)

My favorite feature: USB-C display connector also charges my MBP.

#### Bose QuietComfort 35

I have them for years now and still enjoy using them specially at noisy places like in the plane.

#### [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods)

#### Bose SoundLink Mini II

I am most productive at work with great music, so these bluetooth speakers do a great job providing me this.

#### [iPhone X](https://www.apple.com/iphone)

You know, just my regular phone.

#### [Apple Watch Series 4](https://www.apple.com/watch)

I use it primarily for remote controlling Spotify & Apple TV and tracking my sports activities.

#### [11" iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad)

Has 256 GB memory, I also got the Apple Pencil and Smartfolio Keyboard. I use the iPad mostly when I read books but I feel bad that I'm barely using it in general. Will fix it in the future!

#### [SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD](https://www.sandisk.com/home/ssd/extreme-portable-ssd)

My 1 GB external drive mainly operating as an extra layer for my backups.

#### [Satechi USB-C 3-in-1 combo hub](https://satechi.net/products/satechi-type-c-usb-3-0-3-in-1-combo-hub)

My adapter for things like memory cards.
