# Uses

Although I try to keep my setup as minimal as possible, I often end getting stuff to improve my workflows.

## Hardware

#### [13" MacBook Pro (Late 2016)](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro)

- Maxed-out
- 1GB SSD
- Yes, two keyboard buttons stopped working once in 2018

#### [Magic Keyboard](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/MLA22LL?wid=890&hei=890&fmt=jpeg&qlt=95&op_usm=0.5,0.5&.v=1496944005839)

I tried once the one with the numeric keypad, but barely used them so switched back to the compact one.

#### [Magic Mouse](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/MLA02?wid=890&hei=890&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&op_usm=0.5,0.5&.v=1564098735372)

I love everything about it except the charging notification at 2%.

#### [27" LG 27UD88-W 4K monitor](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UD88-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor)
