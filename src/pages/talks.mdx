# Talks

I love to share everything I learn during my career as a developer. So here are all topics I spoke about.

<Talks />

## Building modern React Applications

With the new additions to React, the way we build frontend applications is evolving, leading to improved performance and maintainability. As of today, the most noticeable React API additions are _Context_, _Hooks_ and _Suspense_. How do we apply new best practices to manage our application state? What are common techniques for fetching data? How do we architect modern React applications using a type system and a design system?

In this talk, we'll walk through emerging patterns that helps us write exquisite React applications today.

## Drawing the line between 3rd party and handcrafted code

Often when we write new code, we might be like: Come on, there must be something out there! And most times there was already someone who faced the same problem... only that it's not quite the same.

Should I use the 3rd party lib? Or go with my own? Let's find out the differences and drawbacks in this session.

## With great power comes great React Hooks!

The React team has been working hard on changing the game of writing declarative components: Hooks! With [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/hooks) we are now able to use the capabilities of class components in functional components. In this talk we are going to discover the Hooks API and explore some exciting patterns using them.

## Building zero-config tools for GraphQL

Adopting GraphQL can be fairly demanding and it takes some time to find the right tooling setup. What can we do to improve DX and supercharge our GraphQL development? Let's deep-dive into the journey of [Graphpack](https://github.com/glennreyes/graphpack), a zero-config tool that helps us building GraphQL at scale.

## From learning to thinking in GraphQL

GraphQL has unlocked exciting possibilities on how we fetch data these days. Over the past years we've witnessed a huge amount of toolings and a solid ecosystem around GraphQL.

Everything in the web is evolving so fast and we have to keep up and build products at this pace. In GraphQL there are some concerns and hurdles that need to be overcome such as _Server Setup_, _Schema Design_, _Authentication_, _Access Control_, _Storing Data_, _Batching_ and _Caching_.

In this talk we will explore _GraphQL_ and some common _GraphQL Design Patterns_ to encourage engineers to use GraphQL for efficient data fetching.

## Optimizing apps with Code Splitting

Shipping apps is easy, but shipping GREAT apps takes quite some effort. We want to build faster web apps and deliver as less as needed. But how? Dynamic imports provide a convenient capability to load components. Weâ€™ll leverage Code Splitting with minimal effort and discuss common approaches.
