# Hello, I'm Glenn.

I'm a software developer currently building products for myself and helping companies build amazing products. Although I'm from the Philippines, I was born, grew up and have always lived in Vienna, Austria. After graduating secondary school at the Higher Technical Education Institute, I went for three years to [UAS](https://www.technikum-wien.at/en/) where I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Engineering.

During my career as a developer, I've helped several companies such as [nexxar](https://nexxar.com), [Styria](https://styria.com), [AmazeeLabs](https://amazeelabs.com), [Volkswagen](http://volkswagen.com) & [Kleiner Perkins](https://kleinerperkins.com) to ship great products.

I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and work through [workshops](/workshops/), [speaking](/talks/) at tech events and writing [open-source software](https://github.com/glennreyes).

When I'm not coding, you'll find me either traveling, diving, [swimming, running, cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14875783) or spending quality time with the family.
